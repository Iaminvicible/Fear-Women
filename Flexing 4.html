		<p>I want to share a bit of my experience with ladies. I went for this diocesan program  program and met this young lady her name is Peace. So we got talking and all from there we started developing feelings for each other. About 8days later, I asked her out and of course she said yes. It was like we were in the garden of eden, everything was spicy and interesting, we enjoyed talking to each other. She would always call me every morning to check on me. It was bigger than any good morning message y'all always get, I mean literally. </p>

		<p>It was all smooth rosy till I had my exam at around december. So our chatting and talking reduced because I wanted to focus on reading and not get distracted. Well, I didnt disconnect from her completely though. Fast forward to after my exam when I had time again, I noticed that she was'nt how she used to be i.e she had changed, I didn't get my good morning calls anymore, her vibe while chatting was completely off, she could go days without talking with me. When I could't place what I did wrong, I confronted her about it and she claimed I changed too. I was surprised at what she said and I made a resolution to adjust my lifestyle again because I loved her and wanted what we shared to work out.</p>

		<p>It was just sad that this feminine creature went back to the way she was behaving just after a couple of days. Upon several times that I spoke with her but then nothing changed, I decided to pull out gradually. I just wasnt prepared for the emotional damage she was setting me up for, the nights I had to think about the things I did for her even when I had little or close to nothing, I had to think about the sacrifices I made for her, I just had to forget the memories we shared and the times we played and laughed with each other. I was just done and I began blocking all this feelings from deep within, it wasnt easy. I kept eveyrthing causual and simple.</p>

		<p>So I guess she noticed I was withdrawing from her and then she sent me a breakup message just two days after she claimed she still loved me. I was pained so much but in her word she said and I quote "I'm sorry dear that I haven't been the best girlfriend lately, just that I really need break in this relationship, like I suddenly lose interest in relationship." This shows that I am not at fault in anyway and also there's nothing you can do for this creatures that can be nough for them to hold on to you. Stay tuned for more episodes of experience from ladies I would be dropping. </p>
